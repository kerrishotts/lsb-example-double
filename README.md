# Dual-color Launch Storyboard Example

Based on [the PhoneGap Hello World template](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-template-hello-world); only `config.xml` and launch images have been changed.

The launch image used is below:

![Launch Image](./res/screen/ios/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png)

This image works on all supported iOS devices; the important content is in the center of the image and is small enough that it isn't cropped in any supported viewport orientation or adaptation.
